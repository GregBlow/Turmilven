====== Investigate Caves ======
Created Tuesday 05 March 2019

If descent by well mechanism, mechanism will break when close to water, begin in well chamber.

The caves are comprised of narrow upper passageways that lead down past evidence of past use by an ancient culture (not of plot significance), sconces etc. Reachs a partially flooded cave with Kuo-Toa sentries, one of which should run to the shrine chamber on taking some damage, bringing reinforcements. Connects to well chamber by underwater passage and shrine chamber by dry passage.

Shrine chamber has an ancient diety statue bearing a metal helmet with glowing eyes (dread helm).  This helmet should be caused to topple, with the statue, and kill the Kuo-Toa leader, causing a full rout to the sound of Kuo-Toa shouting 'The Helmet!' in a fit of religious dread.

 Fernantius should be found dead in the well chamber, in same condition as Vandelmo, else dead of violet fungus (roll on , as well as violent fungus growing out of and around dead Kuo-Toa, leaking an oily, antibiotic film into the water, taking on a particularly iridescent sheen where the Kuo-Toa bodies lie. There should be a final route out of the well chamber under water following the bore for a while, which leads eternally unto more empty or dangerous chambers until party is dissuaded to turn back.

If Party did not descend well, bucket, should be floating, suspended in the well (sent by Calpendo) as a horseshoe mechanism.

**Notes**: In this section, the main narrative take away is that a residue from dead kuo-toa (whose madness is considered innate) and violet fungus is leaching into the water, constituting a poison.
