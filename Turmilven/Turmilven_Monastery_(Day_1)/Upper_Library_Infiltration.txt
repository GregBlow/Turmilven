====== Upper Library Infiltration ======
Created Thursday 07 March 2019

Finds Window is not only locked shut, but in fact cannot be opened. Discovers labyrinthine nature of library, and deduce existence of hidden room. If possible have homunculus do slapstick sneaking routine. Reading will induce mild hallucination. May have to evade detection by Bilingar (who, if killed, should drown in own blood), in event of failure be escorted out and told they will be expelled from monastery in the morning. 

Opportunity to acquire calligraphers tools, cartographers tools. Sign posted earlier, plausibly offered as gift to good characters.
