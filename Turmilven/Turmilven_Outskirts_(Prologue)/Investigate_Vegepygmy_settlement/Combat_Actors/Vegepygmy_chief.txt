**Plant Camouflage:** The Vegepygmy has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks it makes in any terrain with ample obscuring plant life.

**Regeneration:** The vegepygmy regains 5 hit points at the start of its turn. If it takes cold, fire, or necrotic damage, this trait doesn't function at the start of the vegepygmy's next turn. The vegepygmy dies only if it starts its turn with 0 hit points and doesn't regenerate. 

**Actions:**

**Multiattack:** The vegepygmy makes two attacks with its claws or two melee attacks with its spear.

**Claws:** Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5ft., one target.
//Hit//: 5 (1d6+2) slashing damage.

**Spear**: Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack: 4 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target.
//Hit//: 5 (1d6+2) piercing damage, or 6 (1d8 + 2) piercing damage if used with two hands to make a melee attack.

~~Spores (1/day): ~~//(plant variant)//
~~A 15-foot-radius cloud of toxic spores extends out from the vegepygmy. The spores spread around corners. Each creature in that area that isn't a plant must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned. While poisoned in this way, a target takes 9 (2d8) poison damage at the start of each of its turns. A target can repeated the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself if a success.~~

**Tactics:**

Melee preference, Disengage at 23hp. Shrieks if hit by cold/fire/necrotic damage, causing allies to swarm damage dealer

**Accoutrements:** Magnificent Pumpkin Crown, necklace of rabbit skulls. Rabit fur cloak and loincloth.
