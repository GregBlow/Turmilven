If either check fails, easy encounter (sentries) in wheat field. Vegepygmies have advantage on stealth check for ambush.  Encounter 1

If the alarm is raised and the party stops for a rest, Encounter 2 begins at rests end.
 
On arriving at the village, the party observes a druid conducting a ritual with an audience. A pumpkin is resting on a large flat stone, ostensibly brought to serve as an altar. More large stones are upright around this altar in a circle.Druid plunges sacrificial dagger into the heart of the pumpkin, reaches in and pulls out a mass of pulp and seeds, at which the spectators exult. On noticing the party after this point, the spectators flee towards the rest of the buildings, encounter 3 starts.

If subdued, Calpendo arrives to rescue.
