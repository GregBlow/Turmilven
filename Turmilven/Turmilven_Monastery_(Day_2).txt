====== Turmilven Monastery (Day 2) ======
Created Thursday 07 March 2019

On waking, have Gui (and central delegation) arrive, welcomed regally by abbot.  This will consitute a sufficient distraction if party is unwelcome by now, and encouraged to ignore instruction to leave by Odsa. As official parties head to Chapter house, party and odsa see Gui blackshirt pass sealed message to Zalvrat, who takes and hides in a secret spot. Message can be intercepted at this point (cellarer is with Abbot) to discover that there is a cult in the monastery that is considered an unorthodox and unreliable asset, but one which is showing some usefulness. That it constitutes sufficient progress. (prop here). If party do not connect to cellarer have Odsa give sufficient indications, prompt to search quarters.

Find Remigeco's accounts of cult history that exposits as to missionary nature, with details of payments, forgeries, methods of manipulation, nature of ink, anomolous phenomena.  Clue to hidden room.

Leaving from here, will be able to discover that Kerig has been bashed in the head. (No reason, just balance) This will not otherwise be discovered for some time due to meeting, was Golachi wot dunnit.

Can also avail distraction of opportunity to reach hidden room, find massive tome Tlon, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius, in which the cult have sought to rewrite the world. Confronted by dord, librarian, and cultists.

If party feels confident of accusing remigeco of anything may scapecoat Zalvrat, who will show far more (but insufficient) intelligence/wisdom in his defence then previously seen.
